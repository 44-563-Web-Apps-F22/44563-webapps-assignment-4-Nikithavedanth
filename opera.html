       <p style="color:blueviolet">
        DES.      I once was a very abandoned person<br>
        MAR.      Making the most of evil chances.<br>
        DES.      Nobody could conceive a worse 'un<br>
        MAR.      Even in all the old romances.<br>
        DES.      I blush for my wild extravagances,
                  But be so kind
                  To bear in mind,<br>
        MAR.      We were the victims of circumstances!
                  That is one of our blameless dances.<br>
        MAR.      I was once an exceedingly odd young lady<br>
        DES.      Suffering much from spleen and vapours.<br>
        MAR.      Clergymen thought my conduct shady<br>
        DES.      She didn't spend much upon linen-drapers.<br>
        MAR.      It certainly entertained the gapers.
                  My ways were strange
                  Beyond all range<br>
        DES.      Paragraphs got into all the papers.
                  
        DES.      We only cut respectable capers.<br>
      
        DES.      I've given up all my wild proceedings.<br>
        MAR.      My taste for a wandering life is waning.<br>
        DES.      Now I'm a dab at penny readings.<br>
        MAR.      They are not remarkably entertaining.
