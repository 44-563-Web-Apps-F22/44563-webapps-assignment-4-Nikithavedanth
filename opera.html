       <h4 style="color:blue">SCENE-Picture Gallery in Ruddigore Castle.<br></h4>
       <h4>The walls are covered with full-length portraits of the Baronets of Ruddigore from the time 
        of James I.—the first being that of Sir Rupert, alluded to in the legend; the last, that of the 
        last deceased Baronet, Sir Roderic.</h4>

        <p style="color:azure">(Enter Despard and Margaret.  They are both dressed in sober black
        of formal cut, and present a strong contrast to their
        appearance in Act I.)</p>
        <p><h3>DUET</h3></p>
                  <h4>DES</h4>I once was a very abandoned person<br>
                  <h4> MAR. </h4>Making the most of evil chances.<br>
                  <h4>DES</h4>Nobody could conceive a worse 'un<br>
                  <h4> MAR. </h4>Even in all the old romances.<br>
                  <h4>DES</h4>I blush for my wild extravagances,But be so kind To bear in mind,<br>
                  <h4> MAR. </h4>We were the victims of circumstances!
                  That is one of our blameless dances.<br>
                  <h4> MAR. </h4> I was once an exceedingly odd young lady<br>
                  <h4>DES</h4>Suffering much from spleen and vapours.<br>
                  <h4></h4>Clergymen thought my conduct shady<br>
                  <h4>DES</h4> She didn't spend much upon linen-drapers.<br>
                  <h4> MAR. </h4>It certainly entertained the gapers. My ways were strange Beyond all range<br>
                  <h4>DES</h4> Paragraphs got into all the papers.
                  <h4>DES</h4> We only cut respectable capers.<br>
                  <h4>DES</h4> I've given up all my wild proceedings.<br>
                  <h4> MAR. </h4> My taste for a wandering life is waning.<br>
                  <h4>DES</h4>Now I'm a dab at penny readings.<br>
                  <h4> MAR.</h4>They are not remarkably entertaining.<br>
                  <h4> DES.</h4> A moderate livelihood we're gaining.<br>
                  <h4> MAR.</h4>In fact we rule A National School.<br>
                  <h4>DES.</h4>  The duties are dull, but I'm not complaining.<br>
                                <p><h3>(Dance.)</h3></p><br>
                  <h4>DES.</h4>  We have been married a week.<br>
                  <h4>MAR.</h4> One happy, happy week!<br>
                  <h4>DES.</h4>  Our new life—<br>
                  <h4>MAR.</h4>  Is delightful indeed!<br>
                  <h4>DES.</h4> So calm!<br>
                  <h4>MAR.</h4> So unimpassioned!  (Wildly).  Master, all this I owe to you!  See, I am no longer wild and untidy.  My hair is combed.
                   My face is washed.  My boots fit!<br>
                  <h4>DES.</h4> Margaret, don't.  Pray restrain yourself.  Remember,
                  you are now a district visitor.<br>
                  <h4>MAR.</h4> A gentle district visitor!<br>
                  <h4> DES.</h4>  You are orderly, methodical, neat; you have your
                  emotions well under control.<br>
                  <h4> MAR.</h4> I have!  (Wildly).  Master, when I think of all you
                  have done for me, I fall at your feet.  I embrace your ankles.  I
                  hug your knees! (Doing so.)<br>
                  <h4>DES.</h4> Hush.  This is not well.  This is calculated to
                  provoke remark.  Be composed, I beg!<br>
                  <h4>MAR.</h4>  Ah! you are angry with poor little Mad Margaret!<br>
                  <h4>DES.</h4>  No, not angry; but a district visitor should learn to
                  eschew melodrama.  Visit the poor, by all means, and give them
                  tea and barley-water, but don't do it as if you were
                  administering a bowl of deadly nightshade.  It upsets them.  Then
                  when you nurse sick people, and find them not as well as could be
                  expected, why go into hysterics?<br>
                  <h4>MAR.</h4> Why not?<br>
                  <h4> DES.</h4>  Because it's too jumpy for a sick-room.<br>
                  <h4> MAR.</h4>  How strange!  Oh, Master! Master!—how shall I express
                  the all-absorbing gratitude that—(about to throw herself at his
                  feet).<br>
                  <h4> DES.</h4>  Now!  (Warningly).<br>
                  <h4> MAR.</h4>  Yes, I know, dear—it shan't occur again.  (He is
                  seated—she sits on the ground by him.)  Shall I tell you one of
                  poor Mad Margaret's odd thoughts?  Well, then, when I am lying
                  awake at night, and the pale moonlight streams through the
                  latticed casement, strange fancies crowd upon my poor mad brain,
                  and I sometimes think that if we could hit upon some word for you
                  to use whenever I am about to relapse—some word that teems with
                  hidden meaning—like "Basingstoke"—it might recall me to my
                  saner self.  For, after all, I am only Mad Margaret!  Daft Meg!
                  Poor Meg!  He! he! he!<br>
                  <h4>DES.</h4>  Poor child, she wanders!  But soft—some one
                  comes—Margaret—pray recollect yourself—Basingstoke, I beg!
                  Margaret, if you don't Basingstoke at once, I shall be seriously
                  angry.<br>
                  <h4> MAR.</h4> (recovering herself).  Basingstoke it is!<br>
                  <h4> DES.</h4>  Then make it so.<br>
                            <p><h3> CHORUS.</h3>

                  He yields!  He answers to our call!<br>
                       We do not ask for more.<br>
                      A sturdy fellow, after all,<br>
                        This latest Ruddigore!<br>
                      All perish in unheard-of woe<br>
                         Who dare our wills defy;<br>
                     We want your pardon, ere we go,<br>
                       For having agonized you so—<br>
                             So pardon us—<br>
                             So pardon us—<br>
                             So pardon us—<br>
                                Or die!</p>
