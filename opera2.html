      <h4> ROB.  Dame Hannah!  This is—this is not what I expected.</h4><br>
      <h4> <span>HAN.</span>  Well, sir, and what would you with me?  Oh, you have
   begun bravely—bravely indeed!  Unappalled by the calm dignity of
   blameless womanhood, your minion has torn me from my spotless
   home, and dragged me, blindfold and shrieking, through hedges,
   over stiles, and across a very difficult country, and left me,
   helpless and trembling, at your mercy!  Yet not helpless, coward
   sir, for approach one step—nay, but the twentieth part of one
   poor inch—and this poniard<p> (produces a very small dagger)</p> shall
   teach ye what it is to lay unholy hands on old Stephen Trusty's
   daughter!</h4><br>
   <h4>  ROB.  Madam, I am extremely sorry for this.  It is not at
   all what I intended—anything more correct—more deeply
   respectful than my intentions towards you, it would be impossible
   for any one—however particular—to desire.</h4><br>
   <h4><span>HAN.</span> Bah, I am not to be tricked by smooth words,
   hypocrite!  But be warned in time, for there are, without, a
   hundred gallant hearts whose trusty blades would hack him limb
   from limb who dared to lay unholy hands on old Stephen Trusty's
   daughter!</h4><br>
   <h4>  ROB.  And this is what it is to embark upon a career of
   unlicensed pleasure!</h4><br>
 
   <p>(Dame Hannah, who has taken a formidable dagger from one of the
        armed figures, throws her small dagger to Robin.)</p><br>
 
        <h4> <span>HAN.</span>Harkye, miscreant, you have secured me, and I am your
   poor prisoner; but if you think I cannot take care of myself you
   are very much mistaken.  Now then, it's one to one, and let the
   best man win!</h4><br>
 
                            <p>(Making for him.)</p><br>
 
                            <h4>   ROB.     <p>(in an agony of terror)</p>.  Don't! don't look at me like
   that!  I can't bear it!  Roderic!  Uncle!  Save me!</h4><br>
 
   <p>(Sir Roderic enters, from his picture.  He comes down the stage.)</p><br>
 
   <h4>   ROD.  What is the matter?  Have you carried her off?</h4><br>
   <h4>     ROB.  I have—she is there—look at her—she terrifies me!</h4><br>
   <h4> ROD. <p> (looking at Hannah)</p>.  Little Nannikin!</h4><br>
   <h4>  <span>HAN.</span><p> (amazed)</p> .  Roddy-doddy!</h4><br>
   <h4>  ROD.  My own old love!  Why, how came you here?</h4><br>
   <h4>   <span>HAN.</span> This brute—he carried me off!  Bodily!  But I'll show
   him! <p> (about to rush at Robin)</p> .</h4><br>
   <h4>   ROD.  Stop!  <p>(To Rob.)</p>   What do you mean by carrying off
   this lady?  Are you aware that once upon a time she was engaged
   to be married to me?  I'm very angry—very angry indeed.</h4><br>
   <h4>  ROB.  Now I hope this will be a lesson to you in future not
   to—</h4><br>
   <h4>  ROD.  Hold your tongue, sir.</h4><br>
   <h4> ROB.  Yes, uncle.</h4><br>
   <h4>   ROD.  Have you given him any encouragement?</h4><br>
   <h4> <span>HAN.</span> <p> (to Rob.)</p> .  Have I given you any encouragement?
   Frankly now, have I?</h4><br>
   <h4> ROB.  No.  Frankly, you have not.  Anything more
   scrupulously correct than your conduct, it would be impossible to
   desire.</h4><br>
   <h4> ROD.  You go away.</h4><br>
   <h4> ROB.  Yes, uncle. </h4><br>
   <p> (Exit Robin.)</p> <br>
   <h4> ROD.  This is a strange meeting after so many years!</h4><br>
   <h4>  <span>HAN.</span> Very.  I thought you were dead.</h4><br>
   <h4> ROD.  I am.  I died ten years ago.</h4><br>
   <h4> <span>HAN.</span>  And are you pretty comfortable?</h4><br>
   <h4>  ROD.  Pretty well—that is—yes, pretty well.</h4><br>
   <h4> <span>HAN. </span> You don't deserve to be, for I loved you all the
   while, dear; and it made me dreadfully unhappy to hear of all
   your goings-on, you bad, bad boy!</h4><br>

                 BALLAD—DAME HANNAH.
 
             There grew a little flower
                  'Neath a great oak tree:
             When the tempest 'gan to lower
                  Little heeded she:
             No need had she to cower,
             For she dreaded not its power—
             She was happy in the bower
                  Of her great oak tree!
                       Sing hey,
                       Lackaday!
                  Let the tears fall free
             For the pretty little flower
                  And the great oak tree!
 
                  <h3 ><span class="chips">SONG</span></h3><br>
                Sing hey,
                       Lackaday! etc.
 
             When she found that he was fickle,
                  Was that great oak tree,
             She was in a pretty pickle,
                  As she well might be—
             But his gallantries were mickle,
             For Death followed with his sickle,
             And her tears began to trickle
                  For her great oak tree!
                       Sing hey,
                       Lackaday! etc.
